TYPO3 extension for the presentation of projects and research projects of universities
with specifically structured data and typified system categories. List view in the form
of a tile display with filtering, which only provides positive filter results based on
system categories, prevents impossible filter combinations and thus always ensures a
positive user experience.

Examples of structured data: start and end year, areas of expertise, type of
cooperation, funding bodies, duration. In conjunction with the `Contact for Pages`
extension, the extension enables an active user journey and thus shows, for example,
project managers, research participants or cooperation partners.
