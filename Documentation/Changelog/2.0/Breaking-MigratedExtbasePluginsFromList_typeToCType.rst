==============================================================
Breaking: Migrated extbase plugins from `list_type` to `CType`
==============================================================

Description
===========

TYPO3 v13 deprecated the `tt_content` sub-type feature, only used for `CType=list` sub-typing also known
as `list_type` and mostly used based on old times for extbase based plugins. It has been possible since
the very beginning to register Extbase Plugins directly as `CType` instead of `CType=list` sub-type, which
has now done.

Technically this is a breaking change, and instances upgrading from `1.x` version of the plugin needs to
update corresponding `tt_content` records in the database and eventually adopt addition, adjustments or
overrides requiring to use the correct CType.


Impact
======

The change relates to following plugins:

* `academicprojects_projectlist`
* `academicprojects_projectlistsingle`

Affected Installations
======================

All installations using the above listed plugins prior V2.0.


Migration
=========

A TYPO3 UpgradeWizard `academicProjects_pluginUpgradeWizard` is provided to migrate
plugins from `CType=list` to dedicated `CTypes` matching the new registration.
