============================================
Important: Switch to `EXT:category_types` v2
============================================

Description
===========

Category type based handling has been streamlined and centralized within the
`EXT:category_types` extension and the known implementation based on deprecated
TYPO3 Enumeration has been replaced with a modern PHP API provided by the
`EXT:category_type` extension.

Extension specific category types are now grouped and are now defined by
newly introduced yaml file format, following a concrete convention to look
and auto-register these files.

`EXT:academic_projects` now ships a default set of partner related category
types, which can be found in `./Configuration/CategoryTypes.yaml`

`EXT:academic_projects` related category types can be extended by any other
TYPO3 extension providing a `Configuration/CategoryTypes.yaml` file containing
category-types using the group-identifier `projects`.

`Configuration/CategoryTypes.yaml` format uses following syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Configuration/CategoryTypes.yaml

    types:
        - identifier: <unique_identifier>
          title: '<type-translation-lable-using-full-LLL-syntax'
          group: projects
          icon: '<icon-file-using-EXT-syntax-needs-to-be-an-as-svg>'

..  important::

    TYPO3 Enumeration based classes has been removed from the extension codebase
    and is considerable breaking, allowed to be done for a major version upgrade.
    Please adopt accordingly to the new handling.
