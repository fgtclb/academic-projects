==================================================================
Feature: "Show hidden records" plugin option for the project lists
==================================================================

Description
===========

A new boolean plugin option **Show hidden records**
(:typoscript:`settings.showHiddenRecords`, checkbox/toggle, default off)
was added to the following plugins:

* **Projects** (:php:`academicprojects_projectlist`)
* **Projects (selected)** (:php:`academicprojects_projectlistsingle`)

Both plugins share the single
:file:`Configuration/FlexForms/ProjectSettings.xml` data structure.

When the option is enabled, the frontend project listing includes hidden
(disabled) records, independent of the Context API visibility settings.
Only the `hidden` enable column (`disabled`) is ignored; the `deleted`,
`starttime`/`endtime` and `fe_group` restrictions stay in effect.

Impact
======

Editors can now opt in per plugin instance to display hidden projects in
the frontend, for example to preview intentionally hidden records without
changing the global preview settings. The option is off by default, so
existing plugin instances keep their current behaviour.

Affected Installations
======================

All installations using the `EXT:academic_projects` extension starting
with version 2.4. No action is required for existing installations.
