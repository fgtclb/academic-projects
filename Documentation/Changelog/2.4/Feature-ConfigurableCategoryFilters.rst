====================================================
Feature: Choose, order and label the project filters
====================================================

Description
===========

The filter form of the :guilabel:`Projects` and the :guilabel:`Projects
(selected)` content elements offered one select for every category type of the
group `projects` that had a category: all of them at once, in the order the
types are registered in, and each with the same "All options" label. Anything
else needed an override of the partial :file:`Project/DemandCategories.html`.

Three settings change that, for the whole site. Each is a constant and, from
TYPO3 v13 on, a site setting of the aggregate set, with the same name:

..  list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   -   Setting
        -   Default
        -   Meaning
    *   -   :typoscript:`plugin.tx_academicprojects.filter.categoryTypes`
        -   empty
        -   The category types to offer, in this order, as a comma separated
            list of type identifiers. Empty offers every type with a category,
            in the order the types are registered in.
    *   -   :typoscript:`plugin.tx_academicprojects.filter.visibleCount`
        -   0
        -   How many filters the form shows right away. The others follow in a
            :guilabel:`More filters` section, a native :html:`<details>`
            element the visitor opens, which is open already while one of its
            filters has a value. 0 shows every filter.
    *   -   :typoscript:`plugin.tx_academicprojects.filter.hideDisabledOptions`
        -   0
        -   Leaves out a category none of the listed projects carries,
            instead of offering it as a disabled option. A selected category is
            always offered.

..  code-block:: yaml
    :caption: config/sites/my-site/settings.yaml

    plugin:
      tx_academicprojects:
        filter:
          visibleCount: 2
          hideDisabledOptions: true

The "All" option of each filter first reads a label of its type,
:xml:`sys_category.projects.allOptions.<type>`, and falls back to
:xml:`sys_category.projects.allOptions` where there is none. The extension ships
no label per type; a site adds them in TypoScript:

..  code-block:: typoscript

    plugin.tx_academicprojects._LOCAL_LANG.default.sys_category.projects.allOptions.competence_field = All competence fields

Impact
======

Without configuration the filters render as before, markup included.

On TYPO3 v12 and v13, TypoScript label overrides of the filters are now read
from another path, see :ref:`important-1790383006`.

The partial :file:`Project/DemandCategories.html` loops the new variables
:html:`{filterTypes.visible}` and :html:`{filterTypes.more}`. Where
:html:`{filterTypes}` does not reach it — a project controller that overrides
:php:`listAction()`, or a template that renders the partial with arguments of
its own instead of :html:`{_all}` — it offers every type with a category, as
before, and the filter types and the visible count have no effect there. To use
them, let the overriding action call the parent action, and pass
:html:`filterTypes` on to the partial.

A project that overrides :file:`Project/DemandCategories.html` keeps its own
markup and none of this reaches it. To use the settings, loop
:html:`{filterTypes.visible}` and :html:`{filterTypes.more}` as the shipped
partial does, and pass
:html:`hideDisabledOptions="{settings.filter.hideDisabledOptions}"` to
:html:`<ct:form.filterSelect>`.
