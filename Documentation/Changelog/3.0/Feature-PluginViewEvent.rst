===================================================
Feature: The plugins dispatch the plugin view event
===================================================

Description
===========

Both project list plugins of :guilabel:`academic_projects` dispatch
:php:`\FGTCLB\AcademicBase\Event\ModifyPluginViewEvent` of
:guilabel:`academic_base`, once each time they render, after assigning their
own variables. A listener adds a variable to their templates without replacing
the controller.

The context of the event names the extension :php:`AcademicProjects` and the
plugin names :php:`ProjectList` and :php:`ProjectListSingle`, which a listener
checks for the plugin it means.

They dispatch it after their list event, :php:`ModifyProjectListEvent`, which
stays.

The event, with an example listener, is described in the `changelog of
academic_base
<https://docs.typo3.org/p/fgtclb/academic-base/main/en-us/Changelog/3.0/Feature-ModifyPluginViewEvent.html>`__.

Impact
======

A project adds a variable to the templates of these plugins with an event
listener instead of a subclass or a copy of the controller. The behaviour is
the same on TYPO3 v13 and v14.
