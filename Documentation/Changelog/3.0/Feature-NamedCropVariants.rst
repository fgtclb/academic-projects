===================================================
Feature: Named crop variants for project page media
===================================================

Description
===========

The image cropper of the media of a project page offers three named crop
variants, so a template of a site package can request a landscape or a portrait
crop by its name:

..  list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   -   Name
        -   Aspect ratio
    *   -   `default`
        -   Free, 16:9, 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1
    *   -   `landscape`
        -   16:9
    *   -   `portrait`
        -   3:4

`default` is the variant TYPO3 offers when a file field configures none, with
the same ratios, so a crop an editor stored before the update keeps its meaning,
and the templates of the extension, which render `default`, show the same image
as before.

The variants are configured on the project page type, so the media of every
other page type keeps what TYPO3 offers.

See :ref:`configuration-crop-variants`.

Impact
======

The cropper shows the new variants next to `default`. Nothing renders
differently until a template requests one of them.

An image carries a crop for `landscape` and `portrait` only once an editor opens
it in the backend form and saves the record; until then a template that requests
one of them renders the image uncropped. That applies to every project page
image that exists before the update, and to one written without the backend
form, by an import for example.

A project that already adds crop variants of its own to these images in TCA, at
:php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']['pages']['types'][30]['columnsOverrides']['media']['config']['overrideChildTca']['columns']['crop']['config']['cropVariants']`,
keeps a variant it sets by name, and its editors see the variants of the
extension it does not define next to its own. A project that assigns the whole
array there replaces the variants of the extension.

Crop variants a project configures on the media field of every page, or on
`sys_file_reference` for every image, are merged with those of the extension on
project pages: the values of the extension win key by key, and a ratio the
project adds to a variant of the same name stays. A project that restricted
`default` to a fixed ratio that way finds the ratios of the TYPO3 default
offered there again.

A variant a site does not want is disabled on the field:

..  code-block:: php
    :caption: Configuration/TCA/Overrides of the site package

    $GLOBALS['TCA']['pages']['types'][30]['columnsOverrides']['media']['config']['overrideChildTca']['columns']['crop']['config']['cropVariants']['portrait']['disabled'] = true;

Not with page TSconfig: `TCEFORM.sys_file_reference.crop.config.cropVariants`
reaches every image below the page, and leaves an image field that configures no
variants without any, `default` included.
