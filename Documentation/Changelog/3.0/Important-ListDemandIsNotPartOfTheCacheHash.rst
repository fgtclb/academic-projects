========================================================
Important: The list demand is not part of the cache hash
========================================================

Description
===========

The project lists redirect a filter submission to a URL carrying the selection
(:ref:`feature-1790226101`). The page such a URL shows is page-cached like any
other - the list itself is not cacheable and is rendered into it on every
request - and the page cache identifier contains every argument the cache hash
covers. With the demand in the hash, the redirect would hand out a valid hash
for any combination of categories, sorting and active state a visitor cares
to submit, each one a page cache entry of its own.

The extension therefore excludes the demand of its plugins,
`tx_academicprojects_projectlist` and `tx_academicprojects_projectlistsingle`,
from the cache hash in its :file:`ext_localconf.php`:

..  code-block:: php

    $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['cacheHash']['excludedParameters'][] = '^tx_academicprojects_projectlist[demand]';
    $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['cacheHash']['excludedParameters'][] = '^tx_academicprojects_projectlistsingle[demand]';

The leading `^` makes each entry a prefix, so every argument below `demand` is
excluded. Every filter URL of a list shares one page cache entry. The URL still
carries a `cHash`, over the `action` and `controller` arguments.

Impact
======

*   The setting is installation-wide, and added to whatever the installation
    configures itself. It names the demand of these plugins and nothing else.
*   Arguments below `demand` need no `cHash`, also with
    :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['cacheHash']['enforceValidation']`
    switched on, which it is in every new installation. A URL that carries the
    `action` or `controller` argument still needs one.
*   The exclusion depends on nothing in the cached page reading the demand: the
    list action is not cacheable, and no other part of the page may take it from
    the URL either - a link with :typoscript:`addQueryString = untrusted`, for
    example, would carry the demand of whoever filled the page cache entry. A
    project that registers the list action as cacheable has to remove these
    entries again, and every filter URL shared until then answers with a 404
    afterwards: its `cHash` was computed without the demand, and
    :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['pageNotFoundOnCHashError']` is on
    by default.
*   A URL whose `cHash` was computed with the demand in it and that carries the
    `action` or `controller` argument as well, as every URL
    `UriBuilder::uriFor()` builds does - one a project's own redirect after the
    POST produced, or a link a template built with demand arguments - fails the
    cache hash check after the update and answers with a 404,
    :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['pageNotFoundOnCHashError']` being
    on by default. Links a template builds get the new hash on their next
    rendering; bookmarks of such URLs do not.
*   A plugin namespace changed with :typoscript:`view.pluginNamespace` is not
    covered.
