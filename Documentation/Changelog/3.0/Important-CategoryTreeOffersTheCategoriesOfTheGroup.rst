Important: The category tree offers the categories of the group
===============================================================

Description
===========

The :guilabel:`Categories` field of the project list and selected projects
plugins offered every category that had a type, including the categories of
other extensions, such as degrees or the regions of partners. The plugins only
ever use the categories of the :php:`projects` group and silently ignored any
other selection.

The tree now offers the categories that carry a type of the :php:`projects`
group, and the categories above them, so a category of the group below a parent
of another type or of none is still reachable. Such a parent can be selected
and is ignored, as before. Types an integrator adds to the group are offered
as well.

Impact
======

Categories of other groups are no longer offered in the tree. The update
itself leaves a selection of such a category that is stored already in place,
and the frontend keeps ignoring it.
