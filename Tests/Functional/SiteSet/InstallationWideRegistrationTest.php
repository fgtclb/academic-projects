/**
 * Draws the line the site set conversion must not cross.
 *
 * Cutting the configuration of this extension per component made its content elements
 * opt-in: they are hidden for the whole installation and a component set brings one back.
 * The page type this extension registers and the backend layout that belongs to it are
 * the opposite case and must stay installation wide, because both are values persisted on
 * :sql:`pages` records. A page carrying doktype 30 or `pagets__AcademicProject` exists
 * before any site configuration is read, and it has to open and render on a site that
 * names no set of this extension at all.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical for this extension family: two of the three already shipped
 * that regression once and documented the fix, because the backend layout used to be
 * imported from the set only and resolved to "[ MISSING LABEL ]" everywhere else.
