/**
 * Proves that the site sets of this extension deliver what their `config.yaml` claims.
 *
 * Both keys of a set are strings that the core resolves at runtime, and both fail
 * silently when they are wrong: `SysTemplateTreeBuilder::handleSetInclude()` and
 * `TsConfigTreeBuilder::getSitePageTsConfigTree()` `file_exists()`-guard the files they
 * read and simply continue when one is missing. A typo in `typoscript:` or in `pagets:`
 * therefore produces no error anywhere, only a site that is configured differently than
 * the integrator expects - which is the whole reason this restructuring exists.
 *
 * This extension adds two failure modes the reference implementation does not have. Its
 * two content elements share one `plugin.tx_academicprojects` block, so a component
 * folder holds nothing but an `include_static_file.txt` naming the shared folder; that
 * file is comma separated and is read by the very same code path for a set as for a
 * `sys_template` record, so a component set that delivers nothing at all is a plausible
 * outcome of getting it wrong - and an invisible one. And the `styles.content` override
 * this extension assigned unconditionally up to 2.3, and through a set of its own after
 * that, is gone: no set and no static template may deliver it any more.
 *
 * The `sys_template` record the probe is imported from carries `clear = 0` on purpose:
 * the backend button "Create a root TypoScript record" writes `clear = 3`, which discards
 * everything the site sets contributed, and so does
 * `FunctionalTestCase::setUpFrontendRootPage()`.
