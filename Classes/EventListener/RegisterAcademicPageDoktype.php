/**
 * Registers the page type of this extension with the PageDoktypeRegistry for TYPO3 v13.
 *
 * TYPO3 v14 resolves the tables allowed on a page type from the TCA option
 * `allowedRecordTypes`, which `Configuration/TCA/Overrides/pages.php` sets. TYPO3 v13
 * has no such option and still asks the registry, and the registry cannot be fed from a
 * TCA override file: on v13 the first `add()` latches an allow list collected from a
 * `TcaSchemaFactory` that is not loaded yet while the overrides run, which costs the
 * `default` page type its `tt_content` entry and makes the DataHandler refuse content
 * elements on every standard page (ACE-462). This event is dispatched one line after
 * `TcaSchemaFactory::load()` and on every request, warm cache included, which is what
 * both halves of that defect need.
 *
 * The version check guards a method that exists on both versions - there is nothing to
 * feature-detect - and calling it on v14 raises the deprecation announcing its removal
 * in TYPO3 v15.
 *
 * @see \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Bootstrap::init()
 * @todo Remove once TYPO3 v13 support is dropped.
