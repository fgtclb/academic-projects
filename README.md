## Description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The 2.x TYPO3 v12 and v13 support is not guaranteed over all extensions
> yet and will most likely not get it. It has only been allowed to install
> all of them with 1.x also in a TYPO3 v12 to combining them in the mono
> repository.
> Support in work and at least planned to be archived when releasing `2.0.0`.
