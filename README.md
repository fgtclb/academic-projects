## Description

> @todo

> [!NOTE]

## Compatibility

| Branch | Version   | TYPO3       | PHP                                     |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| main   | 2.0.x-dev | ~v12 + ~v13 | 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 (depending on TYPO3) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The 2.x TYPO3 v12 and v13 support is not guaranteed over all extensions
> yet and will most likely not get it. It has only been allowed to install
> all of them with 1.x also in a TYPO3 v12 to combining them in the mono
> repository.
> Support in work and at least planned to be archived when releasing `2.0.0`.

## Installation

Install with your flavour:

* [TER](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/academic_projects/)
* Extension Manager
* composer

We prefer composer installation:

```bash
composer require \
  'fgtclb/category-types' \
  'fgtclb/academic-projects'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `2.x.x` is still in development and not all academics extension are fully tested in v12 and v13,
> but can be installed in composer instances to use, test them. Testing and reporting are welcome.

**Testing 2.x.x extension version in projects (composer mode)**

It is already possible to use and test the `2.x` version in composer based instances,
which is encouraged and feedback of issues not detected by us (or pull-requests).

Your project should configure `minimum-stabilty: dev` and `prefer-stable` to allow
requiring each extension but still use stable versions over development versions:

```shell
composer config minimum-stability "dev" \
&& composer config "prefer-stable" true
```

and installed with:

```shell
composer require \
  'fgtclb/category-types':'2.*.*@dev' \
  'fgtclb/academic-projects':'2.*.*@dev'
```

## Upgrade from `1.x`

Upgrading from `1.x` to `2.x` includes breaking changes, which needs to be
addressed manualy in case not automatic upgrade path is available. See the
[UPGRADE.md](./UPGRADE.md) file for details.
